> *Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center generate groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week. They are based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE-FO satellite data and integrated with other observations, using a sophisticated numerical model of land surface water and energy processes.*

That's from the new portal for [NASA GRACE data](https://nasagrace.unl.edu), a collaboration between NASA and National Drought Mitigation Center of University of Nebraska. Here's a super-quick tutorial for accessing and plotting the maps using R.

This will require five libraries: `raster`, `spData`, `tmap`, `dplyr`, and `viridis`. If you don't have those installed then get to it:

```{r, eval = F}
# get required packages
install.packages("raster")
install.packages("spData")
install.packages("tmap")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("viridis")
```

Then you can read download the `.tif` data straight to raster format:

```{r}
library(raster)
url <- "https://nasagrace.unl.edu/data/" # check here for all available files
date <- "20200330" # that's March 30th this year
data_file <- "gws_perc_0125deg_US_20200330.tif" # gws is the groundwater wetness drought indicator... surface soil moisture and rootzone soil moisture are also available
raster(paste0(url, date, "/", data_file)) -> gws_raster
```

Let's take a look at the raster...
```{r}
gws_raster
```

Pretty standard stuff. Now we can plot easily with `tmap`.

```{r}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(gws_raster) +
  tm_raster()
```

Ok that looks pretty cool. Let's polish up with some nice US State boundaries and more impactful color scheme.

```{r}
# get US state boundaries from spData
US_states <- spData::us_states

gws_raster %>% 
  crop(US_states) %>% 
  mask(US_states) ->
  gws_raster_masked

library(tmap)
tm_shape(gws_raster_masked) +
  tm_raster(style = "cont",
            palette = viridis::magma(256, direction = -1),
            title = "Percentile relative to 1948 - 2012") +
  tm_shape(spData::us_states, is.master = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(col = "white", lwd = 2) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, frame = FALSE,
            legend.outside.position = "bottom",
            main.title = "Groundwater Drought Indicator")
```
